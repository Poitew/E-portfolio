# Colophon
## Content
The main purpose of this website is to share my love for programming, showcase my skills, and my favourite projects...  
This blog section, however, is dedicated to sharing my opinions, ideas, and occasionally tutorials on tech-related topics.
While also serving as a notes database that others can read. 

## Tools
The website is built using **TypeScript** leveraging **React** together with **React Router**.  
All posts are written as markdown files which are converted first into plain text using **Vite** and then rendered as HTML thanks to the **react-markdown** library.

```javascript
// MD to plain text
const posts = import.meta.glob("/src/data/posts/*.md", { eager: true, query: '?raw', import: 'default' }) as Record<string, string>;
```

I've chosen TailwindCSS for its CSS-first and mobile-first approach, and framer-motion for animations such as the cursor effect on the main page.
