## Content
The main purpose of this website is to share my love for programming, shwocase skills and my favourite projects.
This blog section, however, is dedicated to sharing my opinions, ideas, and occasionally tutorials on tech-related topics.

## Tools
The website is built using **React** together with **React Router**. All posts are written as markdown files which are converted first into plain text using **Vite** `?raw` option, and then rendered as HTML thanks to the ***react-markdown*** library.
For styling I'm using CSS Modules for Scoped CSS to prevent problems.


## Growth
Right now my portfolio can be considered an almost complete tour of my skills and projects, but I want it to be a sort of database to track my personal growth and a space for taking notes.
