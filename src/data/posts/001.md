# Colophon

## Content

The main purpose of this website is to share my love for programming, showcase my skills, and my favourite projects...  
This blog section, however, is dedicated to sharing my opinions, ideas, and occasionally tutorials on tech-related topics.
While also serving as a notes database that others can read.

## Tools

The website is built using **TypeScript** leveraging **React** together with **React Router**.  
All posts are written as markdown files which are converted first into plain text using **Vite** and then rendered as HTML thanks to the **react-markdown** library.

```javascript
	const posts = import.meta.glob("/src/data/posts/*.md", {
		eager: true,
		query: "?raw",
		import: "default",
	}) as Record<string, string>;
```

I've chosen TailwindCSS for its CSS-first and mobile-first approach, lenis for its incredible smooth-scroll feature, and gsap (ScrollTrigger mainly) for animations.
