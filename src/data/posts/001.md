# Colophon
## Content
The main purpose of this website is to share my love for programming, showcase my skills, and my favourite projects...  
This blog section, however, is dedicated to sharing my opinions, ideas, and occasionally tutorials on tech-related topics. While also serving as a notes database that others can read. 

## Tools
The website is built using **TypeScript** leveraging **React** together with **React Router**.  
All posts are written as markdown files which are converted first into plain text using **Vite** and then rendered as HTML thanks to the **react-markdown** library.

```javascript
// MD to plain text
const posts = import.meta.glob("/src/data/posts/*.md", { eager: true, query: '?raw', import: 'default' }) as Record<string, string>;
```

I've chosen CSS Modules for scoped styling to prevent conflicts, and framer-motion for animations such as the cursor effect on the main page.

## What to expect and main goals
Whenever I learn something new, I like to take notes, and a lot of them. I really wish for the world to see my notes, make them usefull for other people. I'd really like to make something similar to a series of post on a specific topic, like a complete course/tutorial.  
Nothing else I guess... Bye!
