# Your first interpreter
Ever wanted to build an interpreter? No? Well... today we'll build one! Specifically for Brainfuck, an esoteric programming language made up of only 8 simple instructions! (reason why I chose it).
Because we can't implement a language without knowing it first, here is a brief overview of it:

+ **\+**  
    Increment the value at the data pointer by one.

+ **\-**  
    Decrement the value at the data pointer by one.

+ **<**  
    Shift the pointer one place to the left.

+ **\>**  
    Shift the pointer one place to the right.

+ **.**  
    Output the ASCII value at the current data pointer.

+ **[**   
    If the value of the data pointer is 0, we jump one place after the corresponding **]**, otherwise, we execute the code until the corresponding **]**.

+ **]**  
    If the value at the data pointer is 0, continue executing the program normally and thus, exiting the loop; otherwise, we go back to the corresponding **[** and start the loop again.

+ ,  
    Read one byte of input and store it in the cell at the data pointer.

&nbsp;

This little level of abstraction makes simple programs really hard, but its small set of instructions makes it perfect for us.
The language we will use is C++, since it's both a powerful language and equipped with all the tools we need.

## Setup
The first thing we want to do is create a file called `main.cpp` and open it with your favorite text editor or IDE. When using a text editor, make sure to have a compiler installed.

## Starting
The first thing we want to do is include the necessary libraries:

```C++
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <vector>
#include <fstream>
#include <cstdint>
```

1. \<iostream>  
    For standard input and output.

2. \<string>  
    For the `std::string` data type (which is already included by <iostream>, but importing it directly is always preferred)
    
3. \<vector>  
    For the `std::vector` data structure.

4. \<fstream>  
    For reading the code directly from a file.

5. \<cstdint>  
    For the `uint8_t` data type that lets us store 8 bits of data, 0-255.

### The Interpreter class
Now let's really get started. Because Brainfuck is such an easy language, we really don't need the frontend of the interpreter, the part where our source code goes through a bunch of transformations with the purpose of analyzing and creating an intermediate representation of our code.
Instead, we can directly execute code from the source code!

&nbsp;

Firstly, let's create an `Interpreter` class. It should hold an array of 8 bits that act as memory, the source code, and an integer that acts as a pointer.
Next we should initialize everything; per standard, the memory should be of "at least 30,000 cells", of course the pointer is set to 0, and the source code shall be given to us as a parameter.

```C++
// include...
class Interpreter {
private:
    std::vector<uint8_t> memory;
    std::string code;
    int ptr;
public:
    Interpreter(const std::string& code) : 
    memory(30000, 0), code {code}, ptr {0} {}
};
// main function...
```

&nbsp;

Now we need to create our only (public) member function, `run()`! It's basically the core of our interpreter, it iterates the whole source code, checks each character, and executes an action based on it.
```C++
class Interpreter {
    // rest of class..

    void run(){
        for (size_t i = 0; i < code.size(); i++) {
            // ...
        }
    }
};
```

&nbsp;

Since we need to check each character, let's create a big switch:
```C++
void run(){
    for (size_t i = 0; i < code.size(); i++) {
        switch(code.at(i)){
            case '+': break;
            case '-': break;
            case '.': break;
            case '>': break;
            case '<': break;
            case '[': break;
            case ']': break;
            case ',': break;

            default:
                std::cerr << "Error: operator " << code.at(i) << " is not valid\n";
        }
    }
}
```
The switch checks each character of code at the index, and as already said, based on which character is found, an operation is made. The `default` just tells which character is not supposed to be there but doesn't really stop the execution.

&nbsp;

Now let's really start interpreting our code. The operators **+** **-** . are the most straightforward, so we'll start with those:
```C++
void run(){
    for (size_t i = 0; i < code.size(); i++) {
        switch(code.at(i)){
            case '+': memory.at(ptr)++;  break;
            case '-': memory.at(ptr)--;  break;
            case '.': std::cout << static_cast<char>(memory.at(ptr));  break;

            // rest of cases...
        }
    }
}
```
Let's analyze our code: when the **+** character is found, we increment by one the value of the cell at the pointer; meanwhile, the exact opposite happens when the character **-** is found. As for the **.** we just print the value, but first we cast it to char as it's an integer.

&nbsp;

Next up are the **>** and the **<** operators; again, they are really straightforward, but they need some checking:
```C++
void run(){
    for (size_t i = 0; i < code.size(); i++) {
        switch(code.at(i)){
            // rest of cases...

            case '>': {

                ptr++;

                if(ptr >= memory.size()){
                    std::cerr << "Memory overflow\n";
                    exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
                }

                break;
            }

            case '<': {

                ptr--;

                if(ptr < 0){
                    std::cerr << "Memory underflow\n";
                    exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
                }

                break;
            }

            // rest of cases...
        }
    }
}
```
There is much more code than in the past cases; let's see what's going on. When the **>** operator is found, we simply increment the pointer; doing so will make it point to the next cell. However, we need to do some checking. When the pointer starts pointing to a cell out of bounds of the memory we allocated, we immediately stop the execution of the code; otherwise, when accessing the cell at the next operation, we will get a segmentation fault error. The opposite happens with the **<** operator.

&nbsp;

Now to the big deals, the operators **[** **]** are the hardest to implement, but nothing to be afraid of!
```C++
void run(){
    for (size_t i = 0; i < code.size(); i++) {
        switch(code.at(i)){
            // rest of cases...

            case '[': {
                if(memory.at(ptr) == 0){
                    int loop = 1;

                    while(loop > 0 && ++i < code.size() - 1){
                        if(code.at(i) == '['){
                            loop++;
                        }
                        else if(code.at(i) == ']'){
                            loop--;   
                        }
                    }
                }
                break;
            }

            case ']': {
                if(memory.at(ptr) != 0){
                    int loop = 1;

                    while(loop > 0 && --i >= 0){
                        if(code.at(i) == ']'){
                            loop++;
                        }
                        else if(code.at(i) == '['){
                            loop--;   
                        }
                    }
                }
                break;
            }

            // rest of cases...
        }
    }
}
```
Now, what is going on here! Let me explain. 
When the **[** operator is found, we check if the cell has value 0; if it does, we increment our i counter until we find the corresponding **]** and jump to the next cell; otherwise, we simply start executing the next character.
Instead, when **]** is found and the value of the current cell is not 0, we decrement the i counter and start executing the code at the corresponding **[**. If the value is 0, we continue the execution.

&nbsp;

Lastly, for the core, we need to implement the **,** operator for input. Fortunately, it's really easy:
```C++
void run(){
    for (size_t i = 0; i < code.size(); i++) {
        switch(code.at(i)){
            // rest of cases...

            case ',': {
                char input;
                std::cin >> input;
                memory.at(ptr) = static_cast<uint8_t>(input);
                break;
            }

            // the default case
        }
    }
}
```
Nothing to explain here; we take a char as an input and assign it to the current cell after casting it to uint8_t.
Why a char? Because a char is only one byte, and that's what the , operator takes as an input.

### The file reader
And with that we have finished our interpreter core; next is the file reader, and finally we wire all the pieces together in the main() function.
The file reader is pretty easy; we open the file, read the content line by line, and return a string containing each line.
```C++
// includes and interpreter class

std::string get_code(int argc, char* argv[]){
    if(argc != 2){
        std::cerr << "Wrong number of arguments\n";
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }

    std::ifstream read_file {argv[1]};

    if (!read_file.is_open()) {
        std::cerr << "Could not open file: " << argv[1] << "\n";
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }

    std::string code{};
    std::string line{};

    while(getline(read_file, line)){
        code += line;
    }
    return code;
}

// int main
```
In more detail, we check if we have enough arguments. If so, we try to open the file with the second argument (as the first is the name of the file). If the file is not found, we exit the program; if it's found, we start reading line by line the content of it and save each line in a variable. At the end we return the code.


### The main function
And finally, the main() function, where we tie all our code together:
```C++
// rest of code...

int main(int argc, char* argv[]){
    Interpreter interpreter{get_code(argc, argv)};
    interpreter.run();
}
```
And with that we have finished our interpreter, now let's give it a try!

## Trying our interpreter
First thing first, let's create a file called `main.bf` in the same directory and paste this code (it's just a simple Hello World):
```Brainfuck
>++++++++[<+++++++++>-]<.>++++[<+++++++>-]<+.+++++++..+++.>>++++++[<+++++++>-]<+  
+.------------.>++++++[<+++++++++>-]<+.<.+++.------.--------.>>>++++[<++++++++>-  
]<+.
```

&nbsp;

Next is compiling our program. I'm using gcc (g++) as the compiler.
```Shell
$ g++ -o bf.exe main.cpp
```

&nbsp;

Now let's execute our Brainfuck program:
```Shell
$ ./bf.exe main.bf
Hello, World!
```
Nice!

## Last words
And with that you have built your first interpreter! As a challenge, you can expand the interpreter and implement new operators, maybe the / operator that divides the value of the cell in half (beware of dividing by 0!), or the * that doubles it instead. It's your call...
Bye!
